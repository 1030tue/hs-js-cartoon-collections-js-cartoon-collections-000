## Objectives

You're going to get familiar with iterating through arrays in Javascript. 

## Instructions

There are four functions to complete in this lab:

1. Dwarf Roll Call
2. Summon Captain Planet
3. Long Planeteer Calls
4. Find the Cheese

#### Function 1 - Dwarf Roll Call

![dwarves](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/web-dev-readme-photos/cartoon-collections/dwarves.jpg)

This function should accept an array of dwarf names, for instance:

```js
["Doc", "Dopey", "Bashful", "Grumpy"]
```

It should then print out each name using `console.log`. The print-out should look like this:

> 1. Doc
> 2. Dopey
> 3. Bashful
> 4. Grumpy

#### Function 2 - Summon Captain Planet

![captain-planet](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/web-dev-readme-photos/cartoon-collections/captain-planet.jpeg)

This method should accept an array of planeteer calls, like this:

```js
planeteerCalls = ["earth", "wind", "fire", "water", "heart"]
```

It should then capitalize each element and add an exclamation point at the end. The return value of this method should be an array, in this example:

```
summonCaptainPlanet(planeteerCalls)
#=> ["EARTH!", "WIND!", "FIRE!", "WATER!", "HEART!"]
```

Once the test for this method is passing, move on to the next method, long planeteer calls.
