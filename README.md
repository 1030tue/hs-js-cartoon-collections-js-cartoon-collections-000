## Objectives

You're going to get familiar with iterating through arrays in Javascript. 

## Instructions

There are four functions to complete in this lab:

1. Dwarf Roll Call
2. Summon Captain Planet
3. Long Planeteer Calls
4. Find the Cheese

#### Method 1 - Dwarf Roll Call

This method should accept an array of dwarf names, for instance:

```js
["Doc", "Dopey", "Bashful", "Grumpy"]
```

It should then print out each name using `console.log`. The print-out should look like this:

> 1. Doc
> 2. Dopey
> 3. Bashful
> 4. Grumpy
